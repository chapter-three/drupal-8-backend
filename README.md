# Drupal 8 Backend Training

## Description

This hands-on training aspires to give you the tools you need to begin developing custom modules in Drupal 8.

## Notes:

* All terminal commands are run from the Drupal root. 

* `$` indicates a prompt. You do not need to type it into the terminal window.

* `MYDRUPAL` refers to the Drupal root directory or base URL.

* You'll have an easier time if you configure your editor to use spaces instead of tabs. 

* Feel free to ask any of the "Questions you may have ..." someone probably asked the question before!

* If you're using Lando, `composer` becomes `lando composer`, `drush` becomes `lando drush`.  

* See a mistake or typo? Submit a pull request on Github!
